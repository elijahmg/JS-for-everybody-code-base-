// =========== Classic for loop ===========


// Exercise #1
//
// Make a loop which goes from 0 to 10,
// but shows only even numbers
//
// Hint: Even number is the one which remainder after division by two is zero


// Exercise #1
// Print all values from array
// 1. Define an array with 3 names in it
// 2. Store a length of the array in the variable
// 3. Hint: 
//    for (initialization; condition; step) {
//	    // code that is executed repeatedly as long as the condition is // true 
// 	}
// 4. Print every value from array 


// Exercise #3 - *
// 
// Implement a function totalBirdCount
// that accepts an array that contains the bird count per day.
// It should return the total number of birds that you counted.
//
// const birdsPerDay = [2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1, 3, 0, 2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 1];
// totalBirdCount(birdsPerDay);




// =========== For of loop ===========


// Exercise #1
// Create an array with 5 random numbers.
// Go through this array and display only odd numbers using for..of loop.




// =========== While of loop ===========


// Exercise #1
//
// Create a counter with while loop which counts from 0 to 10
// Print every value into console
