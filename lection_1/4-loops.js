// =========== Classic for loop ===========


// Example from slide, simple counter


// Example of the Incerement and decrement



// Example of the Addition assignement and Subtraction assignment


// Example of the different increment value

// Exercise #1
//
// Make a loop which goes from 0 to 10,
// but shows only even numbers
//
// Hint: Even number is the one which remainder after division by two is zero


// Pracrtise together


// Exercise #3 - HOME WORK
// 
// Implement a function totalBirdCount
// that accepts an array that contains the bird count per day.
// It should return the total number of birds that you counted.
//
// const birdsPerDay = [2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1, 3, 0, 2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 1];
// totalBirdCount(birdsPerDay);




// =========== For of loop ===========


// for..of to go through arrays




// Exercise #1
// Create an array with 5 random numbers.
// Go through this array and display only odd numbers using for..of loop.




// =========== While of loop ===========


// Practise together
// Create a counter with while loop which counts from 0 to 10
// Print every value into console



// Exercise #1
//
// Create a counter with while loop which counts from 0 to 10
// Print every value into console
//
// Hint: use increment operator (++)


// Early exit example from the slide
