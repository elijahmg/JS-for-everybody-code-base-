// =========== If - else, else if ===========

// Exercise #1
// Before running a program, think what outcome it will five you
// Put instead of comments console.log with different messages
// Run a program
// Change hasCar and hasPrivateJet to false and check how program behaves now


// =========== Operators ===========


// Exercise #1 (Remainder)
//
// Write a function which takes two arguments
// and check if the remainder of the division of the first argument by 2 is zero,
// than sum those arguments otherwise subtract first argument from the second one.

// As outcome you will have three functions:
// - function which will use either sum or subtract,
// - function to sum values
// - function to subtract values


// Exercise #2
//
// Let's get back to the exercise from previous Function part and implement following condition 
// If multiplication is more than 50, print result into console, otherwise do nothing



// =========== Switch statement ===========


// Exercise #1

// Create a function which takes name of the fruit
// and writes a message to console about price of the fruit using switch statement
// For now assume we have only 3 fruits
// (apple - 3 usd, orange - 5 usd, banana - 7 usd)
// as a default result, print to console message "Unknown price"
